At the beginning I decided to store hashed passwords so I used SHA256. 
However for making it shorter I took first 20 character of hash.
For registiration after users filled the required informations an activation code sent with an email.
Also I added forgot the passwords link for users that are forgot their passwords. 
If they click that link an email will be sent to them. 
That email must have unique url so another user can't find with trying so I used activation code in password reset link. 
Also new unique string can be generated.
Another decision is making emails unique so every email can be registired for once. 
In database, I stored all user information in one table named "User". 
As an expansion one more table could be added name "Roles" that keeps users information for authorization.
I arranged authorization with using cookies and set their expire time to 24 hours.
Also I computed login time for each 24 hour in that way users need to login everyday.
In testing scenarios for inputs if there is a required field is empty user will be informed for filling that fields.
